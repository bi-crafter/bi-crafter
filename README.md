👋 Hi, I'm Abhijit Sarkar
Power BI Developer | Data Analyst | Flutter Developer

I’m a curious builder at heart. Whether it’s analyzing business data or crafting seamless mobile experiences, I love creating things that genuinely help people and solve real problems.

My background combines Business Intelligence and Mobile App Development, which allows me to approach problems from both analytical and product-thinking perspectives. I’ve worked on feature-rich apps like TataNeu, WeRide, and QuestMall, and I’m equally comfortable designing dashboards that tell a compelling data story.

Every project I work on — BI or mobile — is built with the same principles:
clarity, performance, real-world impact, and clean architecture.
